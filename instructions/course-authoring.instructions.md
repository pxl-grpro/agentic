# Course Authoring Instructions

## Purpose

This repository contains course material written in AsciiDoc.
Agents working in this repository MUST produce content that matches the existing course structure and writing style.

The goal is to create complete course material as a set of modules and chapters.

## Scope

These instructions apply to all content created under `Course/`.

Use these rules when you:

- create a new module
- create a new chapter
- update an existing chapter
- propose file or folder names inside the course root
- add code examples, exercises, notes, warnings, tables, or images to a chapter

## Repository Structure

- a course contains multiple modules
- every module is a separate subfolder inside `Course/Modules/`
- every module starts with a `00-objectives.adoc` file
- every module contains one or more additional chapter files
- every chapter is a separate `.adoc` file
- module assets belong inside the module folder
- chapter images belong in the local `images/` folder of that module
- code solutions, demos, or sample projects MAY be stored in a local `source/` folder when needed

Example:

```text
Course/
	Modules/
		05-minimal-api/
			00-objectives.adoc
			01-intro.adoc
			02-results.adoc
			images/
			source/
```

## Naming Rules

Agents MUST use kebab-case for all file and folder names inside `Course/`:

- lowercase letters only
- English words only — no Dutch or other languages
- words separated by hyphens; no spaces, no underscores
- keep the existing numeric prefix pattern for order
- do not rename existing files or folders unless explicitly asked

Examples: `03-api` (valid), `04-labo-template.adoc` (valid), `03_API` (invalid), `04 Labo Template.adoc` (invalid)

## Writing Style

All chapter content MUST be written in Dutch.

- use the `je` form consistently
- keep the tone professional but approachable
- start with a short orientation sentence, then build the explanation step by step
- prefer short, readable paragraphs with concrete examples
- keep each chapter short and focused: introduction → explanation → example → practical usage
- use AsciiDoc elements when useful: bullet lists, numbered lists, tables, NOTE blocks, CAUTION blocks
- keep terminology consistent across chapters and align with the existing course progression

## Admonitions

When obvious tips or pitfalls exist, make them visible with an admonition block:

- use `[TIP]` for best practices — things a student should do to work effectively
- use `[WARNING]` for bad practices — things a student should avoid because they cause problems

AsciiDoc admonition block pattern:

```adoc
[TIP]
====
Tip text here.
====

[WARNING]
====
Warning text here.
====
```

Agents MUST NOT bury best-practice or bad-practice advice in plain paragraph text when an admonition block would make it stand out.

## Code Example Rules

- code examples use English variable names
- code comments are written in English
- code blocks always use an explicit AsciiDoc source tag with the correct language (`csharp`, `json`, `bash`, `powershell`, or `text`)
- code must be minimal but realistic and support the surrounding Dutch explanation
- code should reflect current .NET and ASP.NET Core practices where relevant
- if a code example is intentionally incomplete, mark it with a `TODO` label in the text or code

AsciiDoc code block pattern:

```adoc
[source,csharp]
----
public class InvoiceService
{
    private readonly Calculator _calculator;

    public InvoiceService(Calculator calculator)
    {
        _calculator = calculator;
    }
}
----
```

Agents MUST NOT:

- mix Dutch variable names into code examples
- use untagged code fences where an AsciiDoc source block is required
- add oversized listings when a smaller example explains the concept better

## Hyperlinks

All external hyperlinks MUST open in a new browser tab.
In AsciiDoc, add `^` at the end of the link text to achieve this:

```adoc
https://example.com[https://example.com^]
```

By default, the link text is equal to the link URL.
Only use a different link text when there is a clear reason (e.g. the URL is too long to display meaningfully).

Agents MUST NOT write external links without the `^` modifier.

## Images And Assets

- store images in the module-local `images/` folder
- use kebab-case file names
- `:imagesdir: images` is active in every chapter header

## Course Content Plan

The full list of modules and chapters for this course is maintained in `COURSE.md` at the repository root.

Consult `COURSE.md` before:

- creating a new module or chapter
- deciding on module or chapter numbering
- choosing a title or topic for new content

`COURSE.md` is the single source of truth for which modules exist or are planned, their numeric prefixes, chapter order, and status. Update the status column when content is added or completed.

Agents MUST NOT invent module numbers, folder names, or chapter titles that contradict `COURSE.md`.

## Skills

Use these skills for structured tasks:

- `/new-chapter` — scaffold a new chapter file with the correct header and register it in `COURSE.md`
- `/validate-chapter` — check an existing chapter against all course quality rules and get a PASS/FAIL report
